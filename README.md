- 👋 Hi, I’m @MauroSobhie
- 👀 I’m interested in studying how technology interacts with real life and society. And in learning some coding so as I can bring my ideas to life.
- 🌱 I’m currently a data science apprentice. I am a graduated electronics engineer with PhD in Applied Linguistics running some personal projects. You can find @saguebel at Instagram and TikTok (still in Brazilian Portuguese, but soon in English too).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving practical applications of technology.
- 📫 How to reach me? Here.
